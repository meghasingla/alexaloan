  A mutual fund/SIP is a professionally-managed investment scheme, usually run by an asset management company that brings together a group of people and invests their money in stocks, bonds and other securities as per customer’s needs. There are many types of mutual funds are available for investment and some had a locking period and some had their flexibilities as per guidelines by SEBI. You can buy mutual fund/SIP in the form of 'units', which basically represent your share of holdings in a particular scheme. These units can be purchased or redeemed as on requirements at the currently fund’s net asset value (NAV). NAV is most important thing to look after for any type of investment or redemption. Its shows the current and previous position or value of the company or fund units.

   These NAVs keep fluctuating, according to the fund's holdings and funds nature. So, each investor participates proportionally in the gain or loss of the fund as per their interest.

All the AMC’s and mutual funds are registered with SEBI. All rules and regulations are described by SEBI. They function within the provisions of strict regulation created to 
protect the interests of the investor for avoiding any type of miss selling/cheating.

The biggest advantage of investing through a mutual fund/SIP is that it gives small investors access to professionally-managed, diversified portfolios of equities, bonds and 
other securities, which would be quite difficult to create with a small amount of capital as per investments.
