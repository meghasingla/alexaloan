<p class="text-justify" style="padding-top:25px;">Cash credit facility is a line of credit and it is provided to the borrower on the basis of his projected level of sales, inventories, receivables and cash requirements. This facility is operated in the same prospective as overdraft facility. The cash credit facility is generally given for a period of 12 months and reviewed / revised at the end of the financial year.
<br><br>
To some extent, the Cash Credit facility is problematic for the banks. This is because customers can draw the credit up to their maximum approved credit limit, but practically they crossed the maximum limit at many times. This creates a liquidity problem for the banks. This is also known as “Credit Limit” granted by the bank.</p>

<p class="text-justify">As per Over Draft : Loan arrangement under which a bank extends credit up to a maximum amount against which a current  account customer can issue cheques or make withdrawals. The most common form of business borrowing, an overdraft is a type of revolving loan where deposits (credits) are available for re-borrowing, and interest is charged only on the daily debit withdrawals and total used balance.  This is also known as “Demand Loan”
